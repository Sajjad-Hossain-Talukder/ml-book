# An introduction to Sequence-to-sequence models

Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle tasks where both input and output are sequences, such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. The seq2seq model consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.

## Encoder:

The encoder is responsible for processing the input sequence and encoding it into a fixed-size vector representation, often referred to as the "context vector" or "thought vector." This vector captures the semantic information of the input sequence. The encoder is typically implemented using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to handle the variable-length input sequences.

## Decoder:

The decoder is responsible for generating the output sequence based on the context vector provided by the encoder. It is also typically implemented using an RNN, LSTM, or GRU. The decoder starts generating the output sequence one token at a time, conditioned on the context vector and the previously generated tokens. In other words, the decoder generates a probability distribution over the possible output tokens at each time step, and the token with the highest probability is selected as the output.

## Training:

During training, the seq2seq model learns to map input sequences to target output sequences by minimizing the difference between the predicted output sequence and the actual target sequence, usually using a loss function like cross-entropy. The model parameters are updated using optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam optimizer.

## Example encoder-decoder architecture:

Here is an example of a seq2seq model desigend to do math operations. The input sequence is a sequence of tokens representing a math expression, and the output sequence is a sequence of tokens representing the result of the math expression.

```python

class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        embedded = self.embedding(input).view(1, 1, -1)
        output, hidden = self.lstm(embedded, hidden)
        return output, hidden

class Decoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(output_size, hidden_size)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.out = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, input, hidden):
        embedded = self.embedding(input).view(1, 1, -1)
        output, hidden = self.lstm(embedded, hidden)
        output = self.softmax(self.out(output[0]))
        return output, hidden

```

The author have tried to train the model and evaluate some expression. But the performance was very bad. But, it is still an interesting example to understand the concept of seq2seq models.

## Limitations of seq2seq models asnd its solution:

Despite the success of seq2seq models in various NLP tasks, they have some limitations. For example, the fixed-size context vector can become a bottleneck for capturing long input sequences, leading to the loss of important information. Additionally, the sequential nature of RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs makes parallelization challenging, limiting the model's training and inference speed.

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, addresses these limitations by replacing the recurrent components with self-attention mechanisms, allowing for better handling of long-range dependencies and improved parallelization capabilities.
